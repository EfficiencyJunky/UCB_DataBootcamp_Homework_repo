PROJECT WEEK 2: Making my life as an acquisition manager so much better

In my day job, I run paid acquisition efforts at a small app publisher. My goal is to get the right message in front of the right potential users at the right time at the lowest possible cost. The margins in a business like this can be pretty tight, so it is of extreme importance to be very vigilant about spending and make sure that every dollar counts. 

In order to do this, we need to be advertising on as many ad networks as possible, and efficiently managing spend across all of these platforms. But the problem is, the important information I need to know is spread out in many places. Spend, impressions, views, and clicks come from the Ad Networks, and then Installs, Activations, Trial Starts, Subscriptions, Revenue, and various other enga

Here's a diagram that attempts to explain the dilemma:

So what is going on here?

**DATA SOURCE 1 -- The Ad Networks: Providing top of the funnel data**
To start the process of acquiring users, we give money to a variety of ad networks, and each of these networks individually reports how much we spent, which campaigns/ad-sets/ads we spent the money on and how many impressions, views, clicks we received in return.
