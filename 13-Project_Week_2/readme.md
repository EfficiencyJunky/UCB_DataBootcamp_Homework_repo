PROJECT WEEK 2: Making my life as an acquisition manager so much better

In my day job, I run paid acquisition efforts at a small app publisher. My goal is to get the right message in front of the right potential users at the right time at the lowest possible cost. The margins in a business like this can be pretty tight, so it is of extreme importance to be very vigilant about spending and make sure that every dollar counts. 

In order to do this, we need to be advertising on as many ad networks as possible, and efficiently managing spend across all of these platforms. But the problem is, the important information I need to know is spread out in many places. Spend, impressions, views, and clicks come from the Ad Networks, and then Installs, Activations, Trial Starts, Subscriptions, Revenue, and various other engagement metrics come from us, the Publisher. We send most of this information to a 3rd party aggregator called an MMP (Mobile Measurement Partner) because they also have the special ability to verify where the installs came from.

Here's a diagram that attempts to explain the dilemma:

So what is going on here?

**DATA SOURCE 1 -- The Ad Networks: Providing top of the funnel data**
To start the process of acquiring users, we give money to a variety of ad networks:

 - Facebook
 - Pinterest
 - Google
 - Apple Search Ads
 - Snapchat (coming soon)

Each of these networks individually reports their top of the funnel metrics split out by Campaign/Ad-set/ad:

Here's essentially what they provide:
 - Date
 - Spend
 - Reach/Impressions
 - Views (if applicable)
 - Clicks

**DATA SOURCE 2 -- Install and Post Install Metrics: Mid**
This information alone can't tell us how good our ads are at acquiring qualified users though. For that
