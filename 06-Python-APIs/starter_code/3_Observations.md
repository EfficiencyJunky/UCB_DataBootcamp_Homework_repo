# three observable trends based on the data.

## 1 -- Cities between 0 and -20 latitude seem to have higher average humidity than other parts of the world.


## 2 -- cloudiness doesn't seem to have much of a correlation to latitude, but it does seem to be 0 a lot more than it is not 0. and there's a weird band of cloudiness around the 75% and 90% marks.



## 3 -- wind speed is not usually more than 20 mph. though it seems like it is more likely to have a higher max speed in the areas between 40-80 latitude.
